# To: Product Owner (PO) Agent (Curly)From: BMAD OrchestratorDate: June 2, 2025Subject: Product Backlog Creation and Management for Creator's Deal Hub (CDH) - Next.js Web Platform

### 1. Objective

# Your primary objective is to take the approved ****Product Requirements Document (PRD) Version 1.7**** (ID: `creator-deal-hub-prd.md`) and create, prioritize, and manage the product backlog for the new CDH Next.js web application. This backlog will drive the development sprints and ensure the team is focused on delivering the highest value features for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and subsequent iterations.

### 2. Key Inputs & References

# - ****Primary Input****:

  - `creator-deal-hub-prd.md` (Version 1.7): "Product Requirements Document (PRD): Creator's Deal Hub (CDH) - Next.js Web Platform" – This is your main source for Epics, User Stories, Acceptance Criteria, and overall product scope.

- ****Supporting Contextual Documents****:

  - `web/docs/project-brief/project-brief.md`: "Project Brief: CDH Next.js Web Application" – For overall project vision and goals.

  - `web/docs/research/Microservice Opportunities in the Creator Economy: An SLC-Driven Market Analysis.md`: For market context and potential future directions.

  - `bmad-agent/data/bmad-kb.md`: For understanding BMAD principles, agent roles, and workflow.

  - `bmad-agent/checklists/po-master-checklist.md`: Use this as your guide and checklist for ensuring backlog readiness and completeness.

  - `bmad-agent/templates/story-tmpl.md`: As a reference for structuring detailed user stories if further breakdown is needed.

### 3. Key Tasks for the Product Owner (PO)

# 1. ****Thoroughly Review and Internalize the PRD****:

   - Ensure a deep understanding of the MVP scope (Section 2 of PRD), NFRs (Section 3), User Personas (Section 1.3), and the defined Epics (Section 7) \[cite: creator-deal-hub-prd.md].

   - Pay close attention to the "Out of Scope Ideas Post MVP" (Section 9) to maintain focus for the initial release \[cite: creator-deal-hub-prd.md].

2. ****Product Backlog Creation****:

   - Translate the Epics and User Stories from the PRD (Section 7 and Section 2) into a well-defined product backlog.

   - Ensure each backlog item (e.g., User Story) is:

     - ****Independent****: Can be developed and tested without heavy reliance on other unrelated stories.

     - ****Negotiable****: Details can be refined with the development team.

     - ****Valuable****: Delivers clear value to the user or business.

     - ****Estimable****: Can be reasonably estimated by the development team.

     - ****Small****: Sized appropriately to be completed within a sprint (if necessary, break down larger PRD user stories into smaller, sprint-sized stories).

     - ****Testable****: Has clear acceptance criteria.

   - Refine or add acceptance criteria for each backlog item to ensure clarity and testability. The PRD provides a starting point, but these may need further detail for development.

3. ****Backlog Prioritization****:

   - Work with the Vibe CEO to prioritize the product backlog items, focusing on delivering the highest value features for the MVP first.

   - Consider dependencies between stories when ordering the backlog.

   - Ensure the MVP features outlined in the PRD (Authentication, Deal Management, Invoicing, Settings) are prioritized for the initial launch.

4. ****Backlog Refinement (Grooming)****:

   - Continuously refine the backlog with the development team (once formed) and Scrum Master.

   - Add details, estimates, and clarify requirements for upcoming sprint items.

   - Ensure the backlog remains aligned with the product vision and goals.

5. ****Sprint Planning Collaboration****:

   - Collaborate with the Scrum Master and development team during sprint planning meetings.

   - Clearly communicate the goals for each sprint and the details of the selected backlog items.

   - Be available to answer questions and provide clarifications to the development team throughout the sprint.

6. ****Acceptance of Completed Work****:

   - Review completed backlog items against their acceptance criteria to ensure they meet the requirements before they are considered "done."

7. ****Stakeholder Communication****:

   - Keep the Vibe CEO and other relevant stakeholders informed about the backlog status, priorities, and any changes.

8. ****Utilize BMAD Checklists****:

   - Refer to and complete the `bmad-agent/checklists/po-master-checklist.md` to ensure all PO responsibilities are met and the backlog is in a healthy state.

### 4. Deliverables

# - A ****Prioritized Product Backlog**** for the CDH Next.js Web Application, containing user stories with clear acceptance criteria, ready for sprint planning.

- Regular updates on backlog health and progress.

- Completed `po-master-checklist.md`.

### 5. Initial Focus

# Your initial focus should be on populating the backlog with the MVP features defined in **Section 2** and **Section 7** of the PRD (`creator-deal-hub-prd.md`) and prioritizing these items for the first development sprints.Please confirm your understanding of this prompt and outline your initial steps for tackling the backlog creation. You can start by reviewing the PRD and the PO Master Checklist.
