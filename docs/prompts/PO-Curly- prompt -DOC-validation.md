# To: Product Owner (PO) Agent (Curly)From: BMAD OrchestratorDate: June 2, 2025Subject: Final Validation of Planning Documents, Product Backlog Finalization, and Preparation for Development Kick-off for Creator's Deal Hub (CDH) - Next.js Web Platform

### 1. Objective

# Your primary objectives are to: 1) Conduct a final, comprehensive review and validation of all key planning documents (PRD, Architecture Document, UX/UI Specification, Frontend Architecture Plan) to ensure they are complete, consistent, aligned with the project vision, and ready to guide development.

2) Finalize the Product Backlog (Version 2.0, ID: `product_backlog_v2`), ensuring all MVP features are accurately represented, prioritized, and clearly defined with actionable acceptance criteria.

3) Prepare for the transition to development by defining initial sprint goals (e.g., for Sprint 0/1) and ensuring all artifacts are clear and accessible for the development team and Scrum Master.

4) Diligently complete the `po-master-checklist.md`.

### 3. Key Tasks for the Product Owner (PO - Curly)

# 1. ****Comprehensive Document Validation****:

   - Thoroughly review the PRD, Architecture Document, UX/UI Specification, and Frontend Architecture Plan.

   - ****Check for Consistency****: Ensure terminology, features, and technical decisions are consistent across all documents.

   - ****Verify Alignment****: Confirm that all documents align with the overarching goals stated in the Project Brief and the detailed requirements in the PRD.

   - ****Identify Gaps/Conflicts****: Note any missing information, ambiguities, or conflicting statements between the documents. Raise these for clarification with the relevant agents (PM, Architect, Design Architect) or the Vibe CEO.

   - ****Confirm Readiness for Development****: Assess if these documents collectively provide a sufficiently clear and complete guide for the development team to begin work.

2. ****Product Backlog Finalization (`product_backlog_v2`)****:

   - ****PRD Alignment****: Cross-reference the backlog epics and user stories with the PRD (Sections 2 & 7) to ensure all MVP requirements are captured and accurately reflected.

   - ****Story Clarity & INVEST****: Ensure each user story in the backlog adheres to the INVEST criteria (Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable). Further refine story descriptions and acceptance criteria as needed for maximum clarity.

   - ****Acceptance Criteria Review****: For each story, confirm that acceptance criteria are comprehensive, testable, and truly define what "done" means for that item.

   - ****Prioritization Confirmation****: Review the current prioritization (High, Medium, Low) with the Vibe CEO. Ensure it still reflects the optimal path to delivering MVP value.

   - ****Dependency Check****: Identify and clearly note any critical dependencies between backlog items that will affect sequencing.

   - ****Initial Estimation Readiness****: While detailed estimation is a team activity, ensure stories are clear enough for the development team to begin estimation discussions.

3. ****Sprint Zero / Sprint 1 Preparation****:

   - Based on the prioritized backlog, define potential goals for Sprint 0 (if applicable, e.g., setup, foundational components) and Sprint 1.

   - Identify a candidate set of high-priority user stories for consideration in the first sprint planning session.

4. ****BMAD Process Adherence****:

   - Diligently work through and complete the `bmad-agent/checklists/po-master-checklist.md`. This checklist is designed to ensure all critical PO responsibilities for this phase are addressed.

5. ****Stakeholder Communication & Clarification****:

   - Act as the central point for clarifying product-related questions from the (future) development team or Scrum Master.

   - Communicate any significant findings, required clarifications, or proposed changes from your review to the Vibe CEO.

### 4. Deliverables

# 1. ****Validated Planning Documents****: Confirmation (potentially with a summary report of review findings/actions) that the PRD, Architecture Document, UX/UI Specification, and Frontend Architecture Plan are aligned, consistent, and ready for development.

2. ****Finalized & Prioritized Product Backlog (Version 2.1 or higher)****: An updated version of the product backlog (e.g., ID `product_backlog_v2.1`) reflecting any necessary refinements from your review.

3. ****Completed `po-master-checklist.md`****: Demonstrating thoroughness in fulfilling PO responsibilities for this phase.

4. ****(Optional but Recommended) Proposed Goals for Sprint 1****: A short list of clear, achievable goals for the initial development sprint.

### 5. Initial Focus

# Your immediate focus should be the comprehensive review of all existing planning documents against each other and against the PRD. Concurrently, refine the Product Backlog (`product_backlog_v2`) to ensure it's the true source of work for the development team, accurately reflecting all MVP decisions.Please confirm your understanding of this prompt, Curly. You can begin by scheduling time to thoroughly review all the linked documents and the `po-master-checklist.md`.
